# ProcessDLS
We use a pair of www.correlator.com correlators to capture speckle data from samples.

This code uses JScatter and CONTIN to (batch) process the www.correlator.com .SIN files.

Some demo .SIN files are included.

I could not get Jscatter to work on Mac or Windows, but the code runs nicely on Ubuntu 20.
